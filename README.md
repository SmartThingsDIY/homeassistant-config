# Home Assistant Configuration

Here's my [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) configuration. I have installed HA on a [Lenovo ThinkCentre M93P Tiny](https://amzn.to/3bCllLi/) with an Intel Dual-Core i5-4570T Processor up to 3.60 GHz, 8GB RAM and 240GB SSD. I am currently running HA OS directly on the NUC

I regularly update my configuration files. If you like anything here, Be sure to :star2: my repo!

## Automations I couldn't live without

### Cameras
[Yi 1080](https://amzn.to/3w9Ppax) Wireless IP Security Camera.

I like using this camera because of how easy it is to flash with a custom firmware, so all images stays local within my HA instance and nothing goes to the cloud.

I have it set up to automatically take pictures when movement is detected and send me notifications on my iPhone and Apple watch. Here's a [link to watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCHYBxnZK-E) a step by step video on how I set it up.

### Motion Detectors
I use 2 brands of ZigBee Motion Sensor to detect movement and trigger automations
  * These [SONOFF SNZB-03](https://amzn.to/31hJCEi). They are small and discreet but I found them to be fragile and unreliable.
  * These [Hacbop ZigBee PIR](https://amzn.to/3q2V8xV) that are a little bit more expensive than the [SONOFF SNZB-03](https://amzn.to/31hJCEi) but they are more reliable and have a longer battery life.

## My Home Assistant dashboard

I have one tab for every floor in my house and I put all smart devices of the same floor in the same tab.
I also use one tab for all scenes, one for energy details and one for system monitoring.
Here are some screenshots (please note that these may not be the most updated images, but you should get an idea).
