# Home Assistant Configuration

Here's my [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) configuration. I have installed HA on a [Lenovo ThinkCentre M93P Tiny](https://amzn.to/3bCllLi/) with an Intel Dual-Core i5-4570T Processor up to 3.60 GHz, 8GB RAM and 240GB SSD. I am currently running HA OS directly on the NUC

I regularly update my configuration files. If you like anything here, Be sure to :star2: my repo!

## My Home Assistant dashboard

I have one tab for every floor in my house and I put all smart devices of the same floor in the same tab.
I also use one tab for all scenes, one for energy details and one for system monitoring.
Here are some screenshots (please note that these may not be the most updated images, but you should get an idea).
