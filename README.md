# Home Assistant Configuration

Here's my [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) configuration. I have installed HA on a [Lenovo ThinkCentre M93P Tiny](https://amzn.to/3bCllLi/) with an Intel Dual-Core i5-4570T Processor up to 3.60 GHz, 8GB RAM and 240GB SSD. I am currently running HA OS directly on the NUC

I regularly update my configuration files. If you like anything here, Be sure to :star2: my repo!
